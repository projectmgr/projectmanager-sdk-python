        Uploads a file to a task. ProjectManager allows you to store
        Files connected to other elements of your Workspace such as a
        Project, a Task, or Home. Files are maintained separately based
        on the location where the file was stored. When you upload a
        File, please allow a few moments for the File to be processed
        and verified. ProjectManager may reject File uploads that
        contain problems such as malware. Once a File has completed the
        upload the process, you may retrieve it using the DownloadFile
        API. This API returns a JSON response indicating success or
        failure.
